The sorting visualizer project allows users to see how various sorting algorithms work in real-time. The project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which enables the user interface to be interactive and dynamic.

The user interface of the sorting visualizer consists of a canvas where bars are displayed, representing the data to be sorted. The user can choose the size of the array and the sorting algorithm they want to visualize. Once the user clicks the sort button, the sorting algorithm will start to run, and the bars will move around the canvas until they are sorted.
